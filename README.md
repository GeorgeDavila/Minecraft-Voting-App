A desktop App to automatically open all your Minecraft server voting links straight from the desktop, so people can vote on your server quick & easy. No coding necessary to make it work for your Server's links. 

Versions available for windows, mac, linux, and unix.

## How to Set Up for Your Servers 
You only need to download the folder *myServer_VotingApps*. You should see the .exe files, 3 for different system types.

Now just put your voter links in the text file VoteLinks.txt , each on a different line. IMPORTANT: your txt file should always be in the same folder as the app .exe files. 

If you run into errors make sure the links have the https:// or www. prefixes in them.
