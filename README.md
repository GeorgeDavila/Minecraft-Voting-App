A desktop App to automatically open all your Minecraft server voting links straight from the desktop, so people can vote on your server quick & easy. No coding necessary to make it work for your Server's links. No need to find your server on the web. No need to even be on minecraft to get the perks of voting on your server. 

Versions available for windows, mac, linux, and unix.

## How to Set Up for Your Servers 
You only need to download the folder *myServer_VotingApps*. You should see the .exe files, 3 for different system types.

Now just put your voter links in the text file VoteLinks.txt , each on a different line. IMPORTANT: your txt file should always be in the same folder as the app .exe files. 

Now just make a desktop shortcut for your system type and your all done. You can rename the .exe files and send it out to everyone who uses your server along with the txt file containing your links. 


If you run into errors make sure the links have the https:// or www. prefixes in them.
